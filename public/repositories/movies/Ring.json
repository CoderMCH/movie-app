The film is titled The Ring (stylized as the Ring) in English in Japan and released as Ringu in North America.\nProduction took approximately nine months.[4] Ring and its sequel Spiral were released in Japan at the same time. After its release, Ring was a huge box office success in Japan and was acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups in the Ring franchise, popularized Japanese horror (or \"J-horror\") internationally, and triggered a trend of Western remakes of J-horror films, including the 2002 American film The Ring.",
